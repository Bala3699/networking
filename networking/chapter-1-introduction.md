# 🌐 NETWORKING — CHAPTER 1  
## Introduction to Networking

---

## 1️⃣ What is Networking?

**Networking** is the process of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources.

### Types of Networks
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – Small area like home, office
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – Large area like the Internet
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** – City-wide network

---

## 2️⃣ Why Networking?

Networking is important for:

- **Resource sharing** (printers, files)
- **Communication** (emails, chat, video calls)
- **Internet access**
- **Centralized data management**

## 3️⃣ OSI Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** has **7 layers**:

1. **Application** – Interface for user applications  
2. **Presentation** – Data format, encryption, compression  
3. **Session** – Manages sessions and connections  
4. **Transport** – Data delivery using **TCP / UDP**  
5. **Network** – IP addressing and routing  
6. **Data Link** – MAC addresses, frames  
7. **Physical** – Cables, signals, hardware

### Example
📧 Sending an email travels from:  
**Application → Presentation → Session → Transport → Network → Data Link → Physical**

## 4️⃣ TCP/IP Model

A simpler model with **4 layers**:

1. **Application**
2. **Transport**
3. **Internet**
4. **Network Access**

👉 Used in real-world networking and the Internet.

## 5️⃣ Networking Devices

- **Router** – Connects different networks
- **Switch** – Connects devices within a LAN
- **Hub** – Broadcasts data to all devices (old technology)
- **Firewall** – Protects the network from unauthorized access

---

## ✅ Summary

- Networking connects devices for data sharing
- OSI explains how data flows step-by-step
- TCP/IP is the practical implementation
- Devices help manage and secure networks
